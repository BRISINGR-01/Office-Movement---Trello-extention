# Run 2 Future

As a team, we've developed an innovative product that not only enhances our productivity but also promotes our health and well-being 🚶‍♂️💼. This is our solution for the International Week 2024 Eindhoven at Fontys. The topic was "How to stay human in a technology-driven society". 

Our product? A smart solution that encourages us to take a break from work and go for a short walk. It locks our Trello boards and prompts us with: "Walk 20 meters to the location shown in the image and scan the QR code to unlock this task!" 🌳📱

This initiative underscores the importance of work-life balance, reminding us to step away from our desks occasionally and enjoy some fresh air and movement 🌿💻.
The product consists of three parts: server, an extension and a mobile app.

# Server
The server is written in Express and uses server sent event to maintain a bi-directional connection with the extension.

# Extension
The extension works with [Trello](https://trello.com/). This is a "web-based, kanban-style, list-making application". It is primarily used by teams as a task delegation platform. As you can see in the screenshots, our project blocks random tasks based on a timer and encourages the user to walk to a specific location to unlock the app.
